# Portfolio using React and Tailwind. 

The design is based on a public Figma project: (https://www.figma.com/design/ezFdA7iRou8gMi8JejoUHF/Portfolio-Ui-Design-Template-(Community)?node-id=183-991&p=f&t=RcsL3yacAr6efcNe-0).

For this project, I used components from Flowbite.
Icons: Tabler Icons (Open source: https://tabler.io/icons)

This project is also inspired by another portfolio coded by @midudev (https://github.com/midudev/porfolio.dev).
